# e-Eulers-Number

Euler's number is an important constant that is found in many contexts and is the base for natural logarithms. 
An irrational number denoted by e, Euler's number is 2.71828..., where the digits go on forever in a series that never ends or repeats (similar to pi).

It is the maximum possible result after continously compounding, 100% growth over a time period.
